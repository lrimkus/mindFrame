mindFrame
=========

Another PHP micro-framework.

It is not yet production ready, as no full app has been written on it.

The framework itself is under mindFrame directory. Example of using it is under exampleInc.

There are no tests for the framework, or the app. Feel free to contribute.


Features:
- Micro (11 Classes so far)
- PSR4 Autoloader
- Half decent customizable url mapper
- Lack of Magic
- Dependency injection via IOC (Inversion of Control) container
- etc..
